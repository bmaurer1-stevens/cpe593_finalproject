    "- The generated graph has {num_nodes} nodes and approximately {edge_density * num_nodes * (num_nodes - 1) / 2:.0f} edges.\n",
    "- The degree distribution indicates the presence of both high-degree and low-degree nodes, suggesting some variance in connectivity.\n",
    "- The clustering coefficient histogram shows how tightly knit the neighborhoods are within the graph.\n",
    "- The shortest path calculations using Dijkstra's algorithm reveal the efficiency of traditional methods for simple graph structures.\n",
    "- The graph is {'fully connected' if len(connected_components) == 1 else 'not fully connected'}, which may affect certain models' performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps:\n",
    "- Proceed with model training using ML-based approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict shortest paths or Reinforcement Learning for dynamic pathfinding.\n",
    "- Perform additional experiments on different graph sizes and edge densities to evaluate the robustness and scalability of both traditional and ML-based approaches.\n",
    "- Benchmark the performance (accuracy, speed, and scalability) of ISPF/SPF algorithms against ML models by running simulations of network events (e.g., node failures, link failures, and recoveries).\n",
    "- Develop visualizations and statistical analyses comparing the pathfinding efficiency of each model under different network conditions, and document insights to aid in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.\n",
    "- Optimize the hyperparameters of ML models to improve their predictive accuracy and computational efficiency."
